Thankyou for purchasing the Arteria3d Tropical Pack.

This pack contains lots of different plants, flowers and trees to use to recreate
a beautiful tropical environment for your games, simulations or movies.

There are many formats in the pack.  Please note, the leadwerks materials folder is used
via the GMF leadwerks game engine format and is not required by any other format in the pack.

Scale wise, its always difficult due to the varying formats and each game engines own
scaling method.  Therefore i have provided game formats such as b3d, dae, fbx in a scaling
form that seems relative to many engines.

Torque dts format is scaled correctly for that particular game engine, as is the leadwerks
GMF format. 

I have provided 2 scale versions of the OBJ format, which suits many of the game engines
and applications used. 
OBJ(scaled) is the smaller of the scales exported for this format.

I hope that hasnt confused you!..

I hope you enjoy using the pack and you are always welcome to send your pics to us
of your project usage of the pack.

Enjoy

Steve.. arteria3d project visionary
